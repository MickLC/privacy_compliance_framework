  ## Assessment Results
  
  **Company**: ${ company.name }  
  **Industry**: ${ get_industry_category(company.naics_code) }

  **Employees**: ${ "{:,}".format(int(company.employee_count)) }  
  **Revenue**: ${ "${:,.0f}".format(float(company.annual_revenue)) }
  
  ## Applicable Privacy Laws
  
  % if applicable_jurisdictions and len(applicable_jurisdictions) > 0:
  % for jurisdiction_id in applicable_jurisdictions:
  * **${ get_jurisdiction_name(jurisdiction_id) }**
  % endfor
  % else:
  * No comprehensive privacy laws determined to be applicable
  % endif
  
  ## Generated Documents
  
  % if defined('generated_documents') and generated_documents:
  % for doc_type, doc_file in generated_documents.items():
  * [Download ${ format_document_name(doc_type) }](${ doc_file.url_for() })
  % endfor
  % else:
  * No documents were generated
  % endif
  
  ## Recommendations
  
  % if len(applicable_jurisdictions) > 0:
  Based on your business profile, we recommend:
  
  1. **Immediate Action**: Review generated privacy documentation
  2. **Legal Review**: Have qualified counsel review all documents before implementation
  3. **Implementation**: Deploy privacy notices and update business processes
  4. **Ongoing Compliance**: Schedule regular privacy assessments
  % else:
  While no comprehensive privacy laws currently apply to your business, consider:
  
  1. **Growth Planning**: Monitor business growth against privacy law thresholds
  2. **Best Practices**: Implement privacy-by-design principles
  3. **Future Readiness**: Prepare for potential expansion into regulated jurisdictions
