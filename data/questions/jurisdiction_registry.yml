question: "Step 2: Jurisdictional Analysis"
subquestion: |
  Based on your business profile, we'll now determine which privacy laws apply to your operations.
  
  The system will analyze:
  - Where your business operates
  - Where your customers/clients are located
  - Your industry-specific regulations
  - Data volumes and types you process

question: Applicable Privacy Laws
subquestion: |
  Based on your responses, the following privacy laws apply to your organization:
  
  % if not applicable_jurisdictions:
  **No privacy laws were found to be applicable based on the information provided.**
  
  This might be because your organization falls under small business exemptions or does not process personal data in jurisdictions with comprehensive privacy laws.
  % else:
  % for jurisdiction_id in applicable_jurisdictions:
  * **${ next((j["name"] for j in jurisdiction_registry["jurisdictions"] if j["id"] == jurisdiction_id), jurisdiction_id) }**
  % endfor
  
  % if "tdpsa" in applicable_jurisdictions:
  **Note**: TDPSA applicability was determined using SBA size standards for your NAICS code (${ company_naics_display if defined('company_naics_display') else 'Not specified' }).
  % endif
  
  % if "hipaa" in applicable_jurisdictions and defined('company.naics_code'):
  **Note**: HIPAA applicability was indicated by your healthcare industry classification.
  % endif
  
  % if "glba" in applicable_jurisdictions and defined('company.naics_code'):
  **Note**: GLBA applicability was indicated by your financial services industry classification.
  % endif
  % endif
  
  These laws will determine the requirements for your privacy documentation and practices.
