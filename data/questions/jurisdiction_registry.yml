question: Applicable Privacy Laws
subquestion: |
  Based on your responses, the following privacy laws apply to your organization:
  
  % if not applicable_jurisdictions:
  **No privacy laws were found to be applicable based on the information provided.**
  
  This might be because your organization falls under small business exemptions or does not process personal data in jurisdictions with comprehensive privacy laws.
  % else:
  % for jurisdiction_id in applicable_jurisdictions:
  * **${ next((j["name"] for j in jurisdiction_registry["jurisdictions"] if j["id"] == jurisdiction_id), jurisdiction_id) }**
  % endfor
  % endif
  
  These laws will determine the requirements for your privacy documentation and practices.
